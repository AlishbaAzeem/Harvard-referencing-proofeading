1. In Assignment Requirements & Instructions with weight age 60%, I understand and feel the need to explain that the document provided matches the case study but needed to be written with better clarity in addressing the problematic areas and recommendations.

As per my knowledge, when I entered data entries and provide Insights so I follow the structured format so some sections in this document could be highlighted with more structured formatting especially in business writing.

Given the word limit, The provided document meet the constraint as It exceeds the word limit till 2000 which breaks the rule of PR criteria mentioned in the assessment.
The content should be revised and needed to meet the requirements of 5% allowance maximum.

2. Further In text and full text referencing,
     Following document uses Harvard referencing, but At some areas, In - text citation of bibliography are unmatched. Only the limited references are appropriate while the some references are inconsistent or inappropriate either not formatted or incomplete. Such as In-text citation Alalwan 2017 is present but the full reference should also be mentioned and must be checked for correct format.
Additionally, The bibliography does not follow the alphabetical order with similarity in main text to make sure that all references follows with Arden Harvard Referencing Guide.

3. In order to check the Quality and structure of sentences with 10%, I found with fast forwarding some errors that are grammatical errors and unstructured sentences.
The given sentence needs correction

"The compliance with the established standards is of the utmost importance as is is would be the factor determining if the legal penalties are to be imposed or not…"

The below sentence complies with unclear phrasing
“On the one hand, the recent developments in technology give both good and room for improvement for the Bistro Café.”

These some sentences needed to be corrected for clarity and conciseness in order to make it more readable.

4. Word limit(5%), As above requirement, The word limit exceeded with 2000 words because of some unnecessary sentences incorporated in document so far doesn't meet the Harvard Referencing Guide. Some sentences should be restructured with conciseness and clarity.

Table of content is missing which is major part of structuring and Title Page and references are unformatted, should follow Harvard Referencing Guide.

These are some basic points and my feedback over your given requirement which I understand to apprise you with according to my knowledge, may or may not contain some errors or missing points in feedback.
